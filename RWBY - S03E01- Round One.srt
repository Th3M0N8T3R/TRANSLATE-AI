1
00:00:31,719 --> 00:00:33,179
Hey mom.

2
00:00:34,619 --> 00:00:36,899
Sorry I haven't come by in a while.

3
00:00:36,899 --> 00:00:38,299
Things have been...

4
00:00:38,299 --> 00:00:40,419
Well, things have been pretty busy.

5
00:00:41,079 --> 00:00:42,879
Oh! Dad's here too.

6
00:00:43,219 --> 00:00:45,560
He's, you know...

7
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:46,560
dad.

8
00:00:47,359 --> 00:00:52,659
He's still teaching at Signal, but he told me he's going to be going out on some mission soon.

9
00:00:52,659 --> 00:00:55,159
I think he misses adventuring with you.

10
00:00:57,619 --> 00:00:59,339
I miss you too.

11
00:01:02,159 --> 00:01:04,359
Haven't gotten kicked out of Beacon yet!

12
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:06,240
So that's cool.

13
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:10,359
I think being on a team with Yang helps.

14
00:01:10,359 --> 00:01:12,179
I keep her in line.

15
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:14,700
That was a joke.

16
00:01:14,939 --> 00:01:19,340
She's actually a really great fighter, you can tell she's learned a lot from Dad.

17
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:23,700
Well so are Weiss and Blake. Oh! They're my teammates.

18
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:26,560
Together, we form Team RWBY.

19
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:30,939
And yes, before you ask, that does cause a lot of confusion...

20
00:01:31,359 --> 00:01:34,459
Anyways, uh, I made a bunch of new friends,

21
00:01:34,459 --> 00:01:35,959
and I met some...

22
00:01:35,959 --> 00:01:39,159
...let's just say, odd teachers.

23
00:01:39,959 --> 00:01:42,559
Oh! We've also stopped some bad guys too!

24
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:47,060
I guess it's like they say: Like mother, like daughter.

25
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:53,239
I still wonder why Ozpin let me into the school early.

26
00:01:53,239 --> 00:01:53,240
But uh, I guess he'll tell me one day. You know how he is.

27
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:57,959
But uh, I guess he'll tell me one day. You know how he is.

28
00:01:57,959 --> 00:02:02,239
It's funny, the more I get to know him, the more he starts sounding like uncle Qrow.

29
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:07,560
Oh! Look's like Dad's back. I gotta go!

30
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:11,979
He's dropping me off at Beacon for the tournament match before he goes on his next mission!

31
00:02:11,979 --> 00:02:13,139
Wish me luck!

32
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,540
It was good to talk.

33
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:31,020
Rest in peace Monty Oum

34
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:02,680
O-HO! It seems we have another astonishing bout ahead of us!

35
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,439
Wouldn't you agree, Professor?

36
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:05,219
Doctor.

37
00:03:05,219 --> 00:03:07,120
And yes, Peter, I think it's safe to say:

38
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,840
this match may be one of the closest we've seen in the four-and-four round of the tournament!

39
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:13,580
For those of you just now joining us,

40
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:17,180
Welcome to the Vytal Festival Tournament!

41
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,919
Broadcast live from the Amity Colosseum!

42
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:42,300
If this is your first time watching, allow us to break down the rules.

43
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:45,120
The tournament is divided into three distinctive rounds.

44
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,780
Teams, doubles, and singles.

45
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:48,680
Age and school year are irrelevant.

46
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:52,180
In this tournament, the only attribute being tested... is skill.

47
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:53,340
Correct!

48
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:58,460
The winners of this battle will elect two of their members to represent them in the doubles round.

49
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:03,319
Followed by the winners of that round choosing one member to advance once again!

50
00:04:03,319 --> 00:04:03,320
The remaining combatants will then fight their way through the final bracket
Followed by the winners of that round choosing one member to advance once again!

51

The remaining combatants will then fight their way through the final bracket

52
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:11,900
in the hope of achieving victory for their kingdom!

53
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:16,399
And yes, Peter, these certainly are some spectacular spectacles on which to spectate on.

54
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:20,279
And I don't think anyone tuning in around the world is going to disagree with me on that.

55
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:22,399
Ah, and why would they?

56
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:26,919
Now, let's get back to the match between Team RWBY of Beacon,

57
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,939
and Team ABRN of Haven.

58
00:05:23,379 --> 00:05:24,420
Got your back!

59
00:05:24,759 --> 00:05:26,199
Who's got yours?

60
00:05:31,819 --> 00:05:32,860
My BFF!

61
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:33,480
No.

62
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:36,560
Yes!

63
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:05,439
Whaaat?

64
00:06:42,899 --> 00:06:46,120
Ooooh, double whammy!

65
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:50,339
Reese Chloris is eliminated by ring-out AND Aura level!

66
00:06:50,339 --> 00:06:50,340
OHH she really should've worn a helmet.

68
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:40,939
Yang!

69
00:07:44,199 --> 00:07:44,839
Now!

70
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:05,640
Yes!

71
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:07,780
And that's the match!

72
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:09,939
Team RWBY is victorious!

73
00:08:09,939 --> 00:08:11,339
We did it?

74
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:18,139
WE DID IIIIIIIIIIIIIII--

75
00:08:18,139 --> 00:08:20,620
--is anyone else starving?

76
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:22,639
I may have worked up an appetite.

77
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:29,180
Gee, if only there were somewhere on campus to get food around here.

78
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,360
Oh, wait.

79
00:08:32,899 --> 00:08:35,959
It's okay, Weiss. I forget about the fairgrounds too.

80
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,799
I was being facetious.

81
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:37,800
Wh-- Well, if you were hungry, why didn't you say so!?
I was being facetious.

82

Wh-- Well, if you were hungry, why didn't you say so!?

83
00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:43,500
C'mon! I know just the place.

84
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:54,260
Hey! Might be hard to eat without this!

85
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:57,480
Huh? No, no no no.

86
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:59,759
Ha ha ha, good to see you, Ruby.

87
00:09:00,799 --> 00:09:02,519
Oh, thanks, Emerald!

88
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:06,120
Guess I dropped it. Guh, girl pockets are the worst!

89
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,139
What's up, Em?

90
00:09:07,139 --> 00:09:11,259
Just left the stadium after watching your amazing fight. You guys were awesome!

91
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:14,399
Oh stop it. shut your little stupid face

92
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:16,700
I heard your team progressed the next round, too.

93
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:19,480
You know, I feel like we never see your other teammates.

94
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:21,019
How'd they do in the fight?

95
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:34,379
Hmm, hmm.

96
00:09:35,799 --> 00:09:37,099
Really well.

97
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:40,519
That's great! Uh, why don't we all go out and get some victory food together?

98
00:09:40,519 --> 00:09:43,819
Oh! Gosh, that's so nice of you but,

99
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:47,420
my teammates are all kind of... introverted.

100
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:53,680
Really socially awkward.

101
00:09:54,059 --> 00:09:57,039
Oooh, yeah. I could see that.

102
00:09:57,039 --> 00:10:01,559
So yeah. Looks like Merc and I will be moving on to the Doubles round. What about you guys?

103
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:05,459
Well as the leader of this team, I thought long and hard about this decision.

104
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:06,860
We put it to a vote.

105
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:10,419
Uhh yes but I decided that we should put it to a vote.

106
00:10:10,419 --> 00:10:11,719
We voted for Weiss and Yang.

107
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:13,800
I will happily represent Team RWBY.

108
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,839
Yeah, we're gonna kick some butt!

109
00:10:17,139 --> 00:10:20,439
Well, if Mercury and I see you down the line, don't think we'll go easy on ya.

110
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:22,540
Wouldn't have it any other way.

111
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:24,879
Alright. Well, we're gonna go catch some more fights.

112
00:10:24,879 --> 00:10:26,139
Have fun!

113
00:10:26,139 --> 00:10:27,199
See ya later!

114
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:32,440
So how are the new "friends"?

115
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,419
I hate them.

116
00:10:33,419 --> 00:10:33,420
Orders are orders.
I hate them.

117
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:35,059
Orders are orders.

118
00:10:35,059 --> 00:10:38,879
I just-- How can they be so happy all the time!?

119
00:10:38,879 --> 00:10:40,480
Did you at least get what we want?

120
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,120
It's the heiress and the bimbo.

121
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:45,759
Hmm, alright. At least now we know who we're workin' with.

122
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:56,060
I'll have a bowl of the regular, please.

123
00:10:57,259 --> 00:10:59,700
Ooooh. I'll take the same.

124
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:03,440
Hmm... Do you have anything with a low salt--

125
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:06,420
Ah! Umm... okay?

126
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,800
Aww Weiss! What's the occassion?

127
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,639
Consider it thanks for sending me to the Doubles round.

128
00:11:28,899 --> 00:11:31,799
What? How can my card be declined?

129
00:11:31,799 --> 00:11:34,179
I was barely into my monthly allowance.

130
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,519
Nooo...

131
00:11:36,659 --> 00:11:38,339
Maybe I could help?

132
00:11:39,879 --> 00:11:40,939
Pyrrha!

133
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:42,440
Aw, you don't have to!

134
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,600
BUT SHE COULD!

135
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:47,360
Well, I think you all earned it after that battle.

136
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,899
Mind if we join you?

137
00:12:02,659 --> 00:12:05,159
Are you sure it's wise to have eaten before a fight?

138
00:12:05,159 --> 00:12:07,919
Of course! It will give us energy.

139
00:12:10,919 --> 00:12:14,059
Ughhh if I barf I'm blaming you.

140
00:12:14,059 --> 00:12:15,979
Oh! Aim it at the enemy!

141
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:19,159
Nora! That's disgusting. But if you do feel the urge...

142
00:12:19,159 --> 00:12:20,120
Got it.

143
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,980
Well, we should be off.

144
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:23,519
So, you think you guys are ready?

145
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:24,899
Of course!

146
00:12:24,899 --> 00:12:29,639
We've got a world-renowned fighter on our team, what's basically a ninja, I can bench five of me,

147
00:12:29,899 --> 00:12:30,919
...Jaune,

148
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,759
we've trained all year, our weapons are awesome,

149
00:12:33,759 --> 00:12:36,700
Glynda barely yells at us anymore, and uh...

150
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:38,220
Jaune!

151
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:40,299
Are you gonna take that?

152
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:43,480
She's not wrong...

153
00:12:43,899 --> 00:12:47,000
I'm kidding! He knows I'm kidding.

154
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,139
Don't be so nervous! The worst that could happen is we lose!

155
00:12:50,139 --> 00:12:53,419
Then it's just a few more years of walking around school with everyone knowing we're failures

156
00:12:53,419 --> 00:12:55,839
our friends will slowly abandon us to preserve their social status,

157
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,620
we won't be able to show our faces in class,

158
00:12:57,620 --> 00:12:59,279
no one will sit with us in the cafeteria,

159
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:02,179
Ren and I have no parents, we have no home left to go to

160
00:13:02,179 --> 00:13:05,039
we'll be officially renamed Team LOSE-iper

161
00:13:12,419 --> 00:13:16,059
Sooo yeah. We're feeling pretty good.

162
00:13:16,059 --> 00:13:17,219
Don't fret.

163
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:22,240
If anything, we should be looking forward to a fight with actual guidelines and not...

164
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,300
...well, murderers.

165
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:27,120
Yeah, don't sweat it! We've all faced way worse before.

166
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:32,360
Let's see: Grimm invasions, violent extremists, a destructive sociopath.

167
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:37,139
And that's all while we were still in training! Oh, imagine what it'll be like when we graduate!

168
00:13:37,139 --> 00:13:39,539
Maybe then I'll be able to pay for a meal...

169
00:13:39,539 --> 00:13:43,360
Would Team JNPR please report to the battle grounds immediately.

170
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:47,179
Yes! Like they were scheduled to several minutes ago!

171
00:13:47,179 --> 00:13:47,180
Well, it looks like this is it.
Yes! Like they were scheduled to several minutes ago!

172
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:49,839
Well, it looks like this is it.

173
00:13:51,899 --> 00:13:53,179
Go get 'em!

174
00:14:27,379 --> 00:14:29,139
